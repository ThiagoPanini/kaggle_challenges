# My Kaggle Journey
![](https://i.imgur.com/5TepNu7.png)

After taking some courses involving Data Science and Machine Learning, I was searching for some way to apply the knowledge on real problems. So, since I <b>Kaggle</b>, I went trough some good solutions for the proposed challenges and my journey was awarded with <b>Kernel's Expert</b> level of progression, wich is very rewarding!

Just to illustrate, in Kaggle we can find all kind of problems, from sentimental analysis on e-commerce comments to classics credit card fraud detection. Most implementations has:

- ![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) `Training a Baseline Machine Learning Model`
- ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `Feature Extraction / Feature Analysis`
- ![#000099](https://placehold.it/15/000099/000000?text=+) `Grid Search and Final Model`

The table below shows informations about problems I went trough until now:
